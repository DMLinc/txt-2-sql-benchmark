Don't want to waste time figuring out whether some LLM can work for you?
This app solves it.

## Why?
Shortcomings of current benchmarks (BIRD, Spider, WikiSQL, SParC, etc...):
1) Absent from these are "complicated" queries - for example, queries containing window functions, CTEs, pre-aggregations, among others.
2) The Natural Language prompts typically used are not very complicated, industry-specific, or realistic.
3) None measure how well a generative model performs on a messy and unorganized database, with duplicate tables, unclear column names, and bad data
